***HYDROMANTES PLATYCEPHALUS*** (Mount Lyell Salamander)**. LENTIC HABITAT USE.** Hydromantes platycephalus is endemic to California’s Sierra Nevada mountains (USA), where it is found at elevations ranging from 1220 to 3658 m. Across its range, it is closely associated with damp, rocky habitats, including talus piles, bedrock outcrops, flat rocks on bedrock or decomposed granite, under rocks at the edge of streams, and in waterfall spray zones (Wake and Papenfuss 2005. In Lannoo \[ed.\], Amphibian Declines: The Conservation Status of United States Species, pp. 783–784. University of California Press, Berkeley, California; Hansen and Shedd 2025. California Amphibians and Reptiles. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey). Despite the abundance of lakes and ponds in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, many with rocky shorelines that seem suitable for H. platycephalus, we are not aware of any published accounts describing H. platycephalus utilizing lentic habitats. Here, we provide the first unambiguous description of H. platycephalus occupying lake habitats. Our observations were made in three distinct areas of the Sierra Nevada, including one each in Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks. In Yosemite National Park, in 2024, we surveyed an unnamed lake south of Mount Lyell (lake ID = 70413; 37.7197°N, -119.2805°W, WGS 84, 3322 m elev.) for H. platycephalus. On 19 August, we conducted a nocturnal survey (2100–2230 h) of the northern inlet and the northern lake shore. Two H. platycephalus were observed in the first 100 m of the inlet. On the northern lake shore, we found \> 60 H. platycephalus (Fig. 1). Nearly all were observed on moss, in meadow vegetation, or at the base of a grassy bank along a sandy beach, and within 0–0.5 m of the lake. Notably, of these approximately 60 H. platycephalus, three individuals were found submerged in nearshore portions of the lake. In Kings Canyon National Park, in 2025, PL and GL surveyed an unnamed lake west of Mount Goddard (site id = 10114; 37.1019°N, -118.7370°W, WGS 84, 3409 m elev.) During a nocturnal survey on 08 August (2120–2330 h) of the entire lake shoreline and northeastern inlet, we observed three H. platycephalus on the lake shoreline, two of which were under an overhanging grassy bank within 0–1 m of the lake and one was approximately 5 m from the lake shore on a dry, vegetated slope. In Sequoia National Park, RK, CS, and FP searched for *H. platycephalus* at a site approximately 300 m west of an unnamed lake (site id = 20276; 36.3669°N, -118.4883°W, WGS 84, 3298 m elev.) located in the headwaters of Laurel Creek. Coyote and Laurel Creeks are tributaries of the Kern River. In 2024, during the two nocturnal surveys of 20276, we observed a total of 9 *H. platycephalus* (2 on 15 July, 7 on 16 July), all on the northeast shore. In 2025, we observed 20–30 *H. platycephalus* during each of the two nocturnal surveys of 20276, concentrated on the southeast and northeast shorelines. In both years, *H*. *platycephalus* were observed on wet rocks and moss on the shore within 0–1 m of the lake. On 06 August 2011 (2030–2130 h), RK searched for *H. platycephalus* in seeps flowing over granite outcrops above and approximately 300 m west of an unnamed lake (lake id = 20279; 36.3582°N, -118.4711°W, WGS 84, 3315 m elev.) located in the headwaters of Coyote Creek. This site is 8.1 km southeast of the southernmost known *H. platycephalus* locality west of the Sierra Nevada crest (Wake and Papenfuss 2005), and therefore expands the range of H. platycephalus west of the crest. Our observations of H. platycephalus indicate that, in addition to the known association of H. platycephalus with upland habitats in the Sierra Nevada, the species also utilizes lake shore habitats and even underwater littoral habitats of lakes. The unusually high abundance of H. platycephalus we observed along lake shores during some surveys suggests the previously unrecognized importance of these lentic habitats for this poorly-understood species. For H. platycephalus west of the Sierra Nevada crest, our observations in Sequoia National Park also extend the known range of H. platycephalus south by 3.9 km. This suggests the need for additional surveys of suitable habitats in this area to better describe the range of H. platycephalus in the southernmost Sierra Nevada.
